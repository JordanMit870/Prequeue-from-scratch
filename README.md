# Prequeue-from-scratch
Done during the Fall 2024 semester at UIC. This was made using C++ in Visual Code. For this project, I was given a base file, and my job was to fill out the functions and create tests to see if the code was running smoothly and working on all aspects. To make this I utilized my knowledge of binary search trees and recursion. I also used gtest and gmock to help make my test functions. The code I wrote is in prqueue.h and prqueue_tests.cpp.
